Dear YouTube Team,

I am respecfully writing to appeal the termination of my YouTube channel,
"Celz-V Official" (Channel URL :- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3kHYj4Z14IrsWYKuryx6yg).
I understand that my channel was terminated for violating YouTube's community guidelines,
and I take these guidelines very seriously. However,
I believe that the termination of my channel may have been a mistake,
and I would like to provide some clarification.
The content that led to the termination was intended to be content's purpose-educational, informative, entertainment, etc It was not my intention to violate any policies. 
If any content was found to be in violation, it was unintentional, and I am willing to take corrective actions to ensure it adheres to YouTube's guidelines.

Sincerely
Celso Vailoces
